# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Josiah Benitez**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study Kaboom in order to help me make a fun and simple game in which a player controlled character goes around collecting apples and you win once you get a certain amount of apples

## Implications
##### PROS
* I was able to make a functional game with a goal and a score counter.
* I was able to create a game ending and congratulations for the winner.
* I was able to make my character pick up items and count the items picked up.
##### CONS
* The game doesnt have much depth to it.
* It isn't as good as I was originally aiming for it to be.
