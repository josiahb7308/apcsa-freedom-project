  I have decided on my tool because I want to be able to create a video game using code and kaboom is a good gateway to be able to do that. I tinkered with Kaboom by messing with sprites and making code that causes the sprite to move in different directions depending on which button out of "wasd" is pressed. I did this because it allowed me to get a better feel for things that I would be doing a lot in a game which is pretty much making certain actions and inputs correspond to certain actions and outputs using sprites. I want to make a platformer inspired by games like "Hollow Knight" and as an extreme "Ratchet & Clank". These games both capture the platformer genre on a more simple side and on a more complex side. This is the code that I came up with to make a sprite move when w,a,s, or d are pressed:

  ```js
