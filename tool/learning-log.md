* kaboom.js, https://codakid.com/guide-to-minecraft-modding-with-java/
* I started looking at base code that kaboom had on their website and messing with the sprites and commenting code out to see what does what.
* I didnt really have many challenges because I was trying to just get a feel for it before I dive in fully. One thing I was like "hmm" to was the syntax for the blocks and sprites but I think I can catch on pretty quick to that.
* I wonder how far I can go with this tool and how good and detailed kaboom allows you to get.
* Im going to try to make simple code of a sprite moving around and see how that goes.
